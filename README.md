# 🧹 Layoffs Dataset – Data Cleaning with MySQL

This project performs a complete **data cleaning process using MySQL** on a dataset of global layoffs available on [Kaggle - layoffs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022). The goal is to transform the raw dataset into a clean, standardized, and analytics-ready format that can later be used for further data exploration, reporting, and visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

The original dataset contains records of tech company layoffs from around the world. However, the raw data includes duplicates, inconsistent formats, and null values.

✨ This project focuses on:

Creating a staging table to preserve the raw dataset

Removing duplicate records

Standardizing categorical and numerical data

Fixing incorrect or inconsistent entries (e.g., dates, strings, formatting)

Creating a clean analytics table for further analysis

## 🔍 Why I Built This Project
This project was initiated to enhance my **proficiency in SQL**, particularly in the realm of data cleaning—a fundamental step in any data analysis workflow. Utilizing a publicly available dataset on global tech company layoffs from Kaggle, I aimed to simulate real-world data preprocessing scenarios. The objectives were:

**Practice SQL-based data cleaning**: Implementing techniques such as removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing data formats.

**Understand data inconsistencies**: Gaining insights into common data quality issues and how to address them effectively.

**Prepare data for analysis**: Transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

**Build a portfolio project**: Demonstrating my ability to clean and prepare data using SQL, showcasing this skill to potential employers and collaborators.
